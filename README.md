# LCV
Preliminary code implementing the Latent Causal Variable Model in Matlab.
This software is under development. We plan to add a more detailed documentation and an implementation in R in the near future. For now, documentation is provided within each script.

Contents:

example_script.m: Example script to generate data under the LCV model and run LCV on the  simulated data

simulate_LCV.m: Simulates causal effect sizes and summary statistics under the LCV model

run_LCV.m: Runs LCV on summary statistics for two traits

estimate_k4.m, weighted_mean.m, weighted_regression.m: subroutines of run_LCV.m
